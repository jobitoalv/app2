# Requirements

[installing ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

- Fluffy Tails requires the user to have **Ruby installed** and the **Ruby Gems installed**; detailed in the gem file and listed below. 

- Without installing the ruby gems, the user experience will be negatively impacted as some of the features of BeatTheBlues will not be accessible.

First you will need to clone my repo! 
Navigate in the command line to where you would like this file to be kept on your computer and then you can copy and paste this into your command line:
```git clone git@github.com:jobitoalv/app2.git```

Once the repo has successfully installed, use the command line to navigate to the parent folder entitled ```cd App2 ```

then navigate to the src folder, copy and paste : 
```cd src```




# Gems

Once you are in this file you will need to install the gems that my application requires! If you haven't already, you will need to install bundler. Copy and paste this into your command line: 
``` gem install bundler```

- tty-prompt version 0.23.1

- rspec version 3.10"
