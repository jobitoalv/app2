The main purpose of the app is for any grooming salon wanted to use an user-friendly app to interact with their customer. Customers will be able to make booking , veiw booking, view services .
As a dog lover I know how good it feels when you can find a easy to use app to make your bookings online .

# User Interaction and Experience

THE App will start with a welcoming Message to the grooming salon of your choice with a bright and colorful log , next you will be ask to input your dog`s name, after entering your dog`s name it will than ask you for you dog`s weight if you enter the wrong weight or anything random an error message will appear, it will wait for you to enter the correct information to continue, now enter the dog`s age same thing will happened if you input the incorrect details or number. When you have entered all teh correct details you will be greeting by a "wooff wooff name of dog line" and the page where you can select from the the options of your choices. Which for my app are Make a booking , veiw a booking , view services and exit . Most of the selection from this page will be used control by TTY-PROMPT which minimize the error input from user.

# Planning Process plus future updates 

When I heard that we were creating an app the first idea came up was an dog app cause I was gonna get my dogs groom the next day. At first I wanted to add a lot more funtions such as Add Ons, buying products etc.

I felt that it was more important to keep the app simple so that it would be accessible for my target audience and easier for me to be able to make future updates with the two features I mention above Add ons and products for sale. 

# Trello

I used Trello to organise what u needed to do . I also have a label for future enhancment ideas.
